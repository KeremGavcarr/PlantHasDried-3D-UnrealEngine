# Plant Has Dried

## Overview

This project is my first game developed using Unreal Engine, created as part of the Serious Games course at Istanbul Technical University. The game revolves around completing a series of objectives related to planting and nurturing a plant. The gameplay focuses on time management and objective completion.

## Game Objectives

1. **Collect a Seed:** The first objective is to collect a seed from the designated area.
2. **Plant the Seed:** After collecting the seed, the player must plant it in the specified location.
3. **Water the Plant:** The player needs to water the plant to help it grow.
4. **Maintain the Plant:** Each time the plant is watered, the player extends the timer. The plant must be watered before the timer runs out; otherwise, it will wither, and the game will end.

## Game Features

- **Objective Tracking:** The game features an objective list on the left side of the screen, indicating the current task. As each task is completed, the list updates with the next objective.
- **Timer Mechanism:** The game includes a timer that counts down, requiring the player to complete objectives in a timely manner.
- **End Conditions:** The game ends if the plant is not watered in time, causing it to wither.
